This project is the 2nd version of [TigerStudy](https://study.tigerapps.org), a web application that helps Princeton students find study groups for their classes. This version is a complete rewrite of the original project with a new design and features.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install the project dependencies, run `npm install`.

To run the project, run `npm dev`. To format the code, run `npm format`. To lint the code, run `npm lint`.
